      <h1>The Cat</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a class that represents a cat. It should have properties for
          tiredness, hunger, loneliness, and happiness
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Call
          them something that actually represents what would increase or
          decrease these things, like “feed”, “sleep”, or “pet”.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last, write a method that prints out the cat’s status in each area.
          (Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease
          arbitrary amounts
        </li>
      </ul>
